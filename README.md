## JPACRUDProject

#### Description
This project reads information from a custom-made database with information on recipes. The application searches through this database via keywords (in the recipe name and description), calorie content, cuisine type, cooking time, and meal type.
The user may view each recipe's information, which includes a URL to the recipe directions, update or delete an existing recipe, or add a new recipe to the database, to be searched for at a later time.
